This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in HTML where text within a div initially set to `display: none` doesn't appear, even after using JavaScript to set `display: block`. Additionally, the toggle does not check if the element is already visible, leading to unexpected behavior.  The solution provides a corrected approach that checks the current display style before altering it, providing a more robust toggling functionality.
